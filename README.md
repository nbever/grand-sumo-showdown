# Grand Sumo Showdown

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.3.

## Initial setup

You'll need to install a Git client and the Angular CLI to get going.  Additionally you may desire to get a good code editor... sometihng like Atom, Brackets or Sublime work well as lightweight options!  (Here is a link to Atom: https://atom.io/)

1. Install Git (For Windows: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows)
2. Install NodeJS/NPM: https://nodejs.org/en/
3. Clone this Git Repo:  git clone https://github.com/nbever/grand-sumo-showdown.git (This will create a directory where ever you run this.  It's in this directory that you run all additional commands all in a terminal window)
4. Install Angular CLI: npm install -g @angular/cli
5. Install dependencies: npm install
6. Run the app: ng serve --open

The data files that map the dice rolls to results can be found in the directory src/data.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
